## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Fill in the form and see the card details update in real-time
- Receive error messages when the form is submitted if:
  - Any input field is empty
  - The card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This project helped me get more comfortable using React and challenged my css skills. I've refreshed my knowledge on props, the useRef hook, and implementing classes through JavaScript.

### Continued development

For my next few projects, I will need to educate myself on svgs and ways to scale and resize them, because currently I haven't figured out a simple way to do that. Also, I will figure out a way to create rounded borders with a gradient. Finally, I will further get used to using React, mainly creating even more custom components for smaller things, and passing props more efficiently by passing them through objects.
